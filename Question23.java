/**                     Stack Class In Java
 * A stack is a data structure which follows LIFO (Last In First Out). Java
 * Stack Class falls under the basic Collection Hierarchy Framework in which you
 * can perform the basic operations such as push, pop, etc. We know that Java
 * collection framework includes interfaces and classes. Now, letâ€™s have a clear
 * view of how stack class in Java is arranged in the Java collections framework
 * hierarchy.
 * 
 * We Need To Import Stack Class By Using "import java.util.Stack"  
 * 
 * Methods Of Stack Class In Java
 * empty(),isEmpty() Checks if the stack is empty
 * push() Puts an item to the top of the stack
 * pop() Remove the object from the stack
 * peek() Looks at the object of a stack without removing it
 * search() Searches item in the stack to get its index
 * size()  Returns the size of the Stack or the number of elements present in the Stack.
 *
